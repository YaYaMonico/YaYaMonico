### 🤔 My purpose
<p style="text-align: height;">
    My motto in the tech journey is inspired by a song by Racionais MC's' famous quote: 
    <br>"Opportunities for change are in the present
    Don't wait for the future to change your life,
    Because the future will be a consequence of the present." 💭🧠 
    <br>
    It is the hunger to learn, the boldness to try new things and the passion to positively impact people's lives through 
    <br>programming that drive me to overcome challenges and continue to innovate. In this constantly evolving universe, curiosity and the desire to do something different is what drives me in search of an extraordinary future. 🌍🍃</p>
